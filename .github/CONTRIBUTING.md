## Intro

Like most open source projects, this list exists because of contributer like yourself.
I would like to personally thank you for taking the time to further this list.

## Only awesome is awesome

Research if the stuff you're including is actually awesome. Only put stuff on the list that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much. After all, it's a curation, not a collection.
